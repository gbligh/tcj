        <h3>NO WARRANTY</h3>
        <p>Use at Your Own Risk:  Access to the Site and the Services and the materials provided on the Site and the Services are provided "as is" and without warranties or conditions of any kind either express or implied. BY USING THE SITE AND THE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF THE SITE AND THE SERVICES IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

        <h3>INSECURITY OF INTERNET</h3>
        <p>The Internet is an inherently insecure medium, and sending any online communication provides no guarantee of successful delivery.  Care should be taken to ensure that the content of your online communication is not sensitive or confidential, because we take no responsibility for communication which is intercepted, lost, delayed, or misdelivered.

            LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL YOU BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES FROM US OR OUR OTHERS WHICH YOU MAY SUFFER ARISING, CAUSED, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE OR THE SERVICES, ANY ACCURACY, INCOMPLETENESS, OR INCORRECTNESS CONTAINED ON THE MATERIALS DISPLAYED, ACCESSED, USED OR PURCHASED THROUGH THE SITE, OR YOUR RELIANCE OR ACTING UPON THE MATERIALS ON OR PURCHASED THROUGH THE SITE, INCLUDING, ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES IN THE NATURE OF OR RELATING TO LOST BUSINESS, LOST SAVINGS, LOST DATA, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITE AND THE SERVICES AND DATA CONTAINED ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR THE SERVICES AND/OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT, IN EQUITY, AT LAW OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE OR HAD BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE LIABILITY OF US AND OUR OTHERS TO YOU FOR DAMAGES SUFFERED BY YOU ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO OR CAUSED BY THE SITE, THE SERVICES OR THE USE THEREOF, EXCEED A MAXIMUM AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE SERVICES IN THE THREE-MONTHS' PERIOD WHICH PRECEDES THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH DAMAGES.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS SECTION REFLECTS THE ALLOCATION OF RISK SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT WE WOULD NOT PERMIT YOU TO ACCESS AND USE OUR SITE OR SERVICES WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY. 
            
            RELEASE:  YOU AGREE TO RELEASE, REMISE, AND ACQUIT US, AND OUR OTHERS, FROM ANY CLAIMS, ACTIONS, DEMANDS, COSTS AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR TORT, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, OR BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE, HOWSOEVER CAUSED, WITH RESPECT TO YOUR USE OF, OR OUR OPERATION OF, THE SITE AND THE SERVICES, EXCEPT AS MAY BE SET OUT IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH.
            
            INDEMNITY:  You agree to indemnify, save and hold harmless us and our Others, from and against any claims, actions, demands, judgments, awards, declarations, orders, settlements, damages (including general, special, punitive, aggravated or exemplary damages), liabilities, losses, costs, charges, interest and expenses, or proceedings of any kind whatsoever which may be initiated or presented by any other persons, individuals or other legal entities, and which arise directly or indirectly from your use of or reliance on the Site or the Services or information available on or through the Site or the Services.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you hereby agree to pay all costs, fees and expenses, on a solicitor and own client basis, which may be incurred by us and our Others, relating to your use of or reliance on the Site or the Services and information available on or through the Site or the Services.
            </p>
        <h3>PURCHASES AND PAYMENT</h3>
        <p>Terms of Payment:  Terms of payment are as set out on the Site, from time to time.  Your purchase is complete when you receive an email confirmation that your purchase has been accepted.  Any purchase of Services through a subscription plan will be subject to an initial charge and periodic recurring charges, until your subscription plan is cancelled in accordance with the procedure that is made available through the Site, from time to time.  Information provided in connection with a purchase of the Services must be accurate and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card or PayPal account (as the case may be), used in connection with a purchase of the Services at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. Any payment you owe us, based on your purchase of Services, or otherwise, is referred to in this Agreement as the “Fees”.  

            Currency:  All prices quoted are payable in the currency identified on the Site.
            
            Chargebacks and Disputes:  You agree to indemnify and hold harmless The Canadian Jetsetter and our Others, against any chargeback costs (plus any related fees) which we are required to pay, as a result of a payment dispute with you or in relation to a payment you have made to us through the Site or the Services.
            
            Taxes:  The cost of all applicable taxes arising from your use of the Services shall be added to the Fees that you are responsible for paying us. Third Party Payment Processor:  Payment of the Fees is processed by and through a third party payment processor, which may be made available to you through the Site, or otherwise (such as through a supplier).  The processing of your payment is therefore conducted by an entity wholly separate from and independent of The Canadian Jetsetter, and we hereby disclaim absolutely any and all liability, whether, direct, indirect, vicarious or otherwise, for the processing of your payment.  You acknowledge and agree that we provide access to such third party payment processors "as is" without any warranties, representations or conditions of any kind.  Your use of third party payment processors is entirely at your own discretion and you should ensure you are familiar with, and approve, the terms on which such services are provided by the relevant third party payment processors.  Your personal credit card details are subject to the security policies and systems employed by the third party payment processor.  As such, you are advised to make yourself familiar with such security policies and systems.  Other payment methods may be made available in the future, and you should read this Agreement periodically for the payment methods that may then be available.    
            </p>
        <h3>SHIPPING OF PRODCUTS AND RISK OF LOSS</h3>
        <p>Any products purchased from us are delivered to you pursuant to a shipment contract.  Following our delivery of the product to the shipment carrier, we will not be responsible for products that are lost, damaged or stolen during shipping.  Any unshipped product, resulting from your refusal or inability to take delivery, remaining in our possession 30 days after the date of this Agreement, shall become our property.  Additional shipping terms shall be as set out in any specific shipping policies that may be posted on the Site, from time to time (which policies shall prevail and govern over this Agreement, in the event of conflict).</p>
        <h3>RETURNS AND REFUNDS</h3>
        <p>Subject to any specific return and refund policies that may be posted on the Site, from time to time (which policies shall prevail and govern over this Agreement, in the event of conflict), if our Services are not as described or a purchased product is damaged (other than by the shipping process), your sole remedy is to contact us at the email address set out below, with a description of your concern, and we will discuss replacement options with you.  Otherwise, all sales are final.</p>
        <h3>CONFLICT OF LAWS</h3>
        <p>Applicable Laws:  We are physically located within the Province of Manitoba, Canada.  This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the Province of Manitoba and the laws of Canada applicable therein and shall be treated in all respects as a Manitoba contract, without reference to the principles of conflicts of law. In the event of a dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or your use of the Site or the Services, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of Manitoba’s courts.

            Exclusion of Laws: We expressly exclude the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, and The International Sale of Goods Act (Manitoba), as amended, replaced or re-enacted from time to time.  
            
            Waiver of Rights:  You agree to waive any right you may have to: (a) a trial by jury; and (b) commence or participate in any class action against us related to your use of the Site, the exchange of electronic documents between us or this Agreement and, where, applicable, you also agree to opt out of any class proceedings against us or our licensors.  
            
            Agreement in English:  The parties hereto have required that this Agreement and all documents relating thereto be drawn up in English. Nous avons demandé que cette convention ainsi que tous les documents qui s’y rattachent soient rédigés en anglais.
            </p>
        <h3>SITE POLICIES, MODIFICATION, AND SEVERABILITY</h3>
        <p>Please review our other policies, including without limitation THE CANADIAN JETSETTER PRIVACY POLICY, that are posted on the Site. These policies also govern your access to and use of the Site and the Services. We reserve the right to make changes to the Site, our policies, and this Agreement at any time and your continued use of the Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of those changes. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</p>
        <h3>FORCE MAJEURE</h3>
        <p>We will not be liable for failure or delay in our performance of our obligations under this Agreement due to any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, but not limited to: (a) acts of God; or (b) failure or disruptions in third-party-controlled or operated communications facilities; or (c) worms, viruses and other disabling or disruptive software, communications or files.  </p>
        <h3>TERMINATION</h3>
        <p>Suspension of your Use of the Site:  If you breach any provision of this Agreement, you may no longer use the Site.  We may at any time and for any reason, with or without cause, and in our sole discretion, immediately suspend or terminate (in whole or in part) your permission to use the Site or the Services, all without any notice or liability to you or any other person.  

            No Refunds or Rights on Termination:  We shall not be responsible for refunding any Fees or otherwise paying any funds, amounts or credits that we may owe to you if we have suspended or terminated your permission to use the Site or any part thereof.  We reserve the right to cease, suspend or interrupt operation of or access to the Site or any part thereof, and shall not be required to provide any notice in respect of such cessation, suspension or interruption of access, nor shall we have any liability for such cessation, suspension or interruption of access.
            </p>
        <h3>MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
        <p>Any provision of this Agreement that must survive to fulfill its essential purpose (whether expressly stated as such or not) and any obligation you have to pay Fees incurred before termination will survive the termination of this Agreement.  Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.  We may assign this Agreement without restriction.
