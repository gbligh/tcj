        <div class="js-header">üåç Spotlight on Calgary to Frankfurt Route! üåç</div>
        <p>Although Air Canada is pulling out of Calgary in a major way there is still a Star Alliance route that Calgarians
            (and most Western Canadians) can take advantage of. EW Discover (a Lufthansa subsidiary) has a 1-2 times daily
            Calgary to Frankfurt route that is a hidden gem worth exploring.</p>

        <p>The perks? A consistent 70K for business class and 40K for economy, coupled with abundant availability. This
            route not only serves Calgarians but also offers those from other Western Canadian cities a seamless connection
            to numerous European destinations. Case in point: I was looking at Edmonton to Calgary to Frankfurt to Dublin,
            which came in at a competitive 70K for business right through Air Canada‚Äôs search tool. However, be prepared
            for a mixed cabin experience, with economy on some of the shorter legs.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs not all sunshine and rainbows though. The business class cabin features a 2-2-2 configuration which is
            outdated at this point. it's a trade-off for the accessibility and affordability it offers. ‚úàÔ∏èüåÜüè∞</p>

        <p>Air Canada's Business Class on the Toronto to Dublin route offers a premium experience for just around 57K
            Aeroplan points. The highlight? The significantly lower fees. While a business class points flight from London

            experience luxury travel to Europe without the hefty extra charges. Opt for Dublin, save on fees, and travel in
