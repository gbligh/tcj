        </ul>

        <h3>Grocery and Restaurant</h3>
        <p>The amount of points earned on grocery and restaurant purchases depends on the total gross monthly amount charged to the credit card account, regardless of the purchase category. You will earn 5 points for every dollar in eligible grocery and restaurant purchases The accumulation of 5 points per dollar of purchase is valid until a total of $2,500 in gross monthly purchases is charged to the account. After that, you will earn 2 points per dollar in eligible grocery and restaurant purchases. The total gross monthly amount is calculated based on your monthly billing period. Grocery purchases include any purchase made at a store that primarily sells food, i.e., grocery store, delicatessen, supermarket, greengrocer or specialty food store. Ready-to-eat meal services and meal delivery services are eligible. This definition excludes purchases made at retail stores and big box stores whose core business is the sale of non-food items. Certain merchants may sell products and services that appear identical or similar to those sold by eligible merchants, or may be separate merchants located on the same premises as eligible merchants, but are classified in different categories by Mastercard. For purchases at other merchants, you will only earn regular rewards points. Restaurant purchases include purchases at a restaurant, fast food restaurant, bar, nightclub or pub.</p>

        <h3>Gas and Electric Vehicle Charging</h3>
        <p>To earn 2 points per dollar in purchases, you will need to purchase gas or an electrical vehicle charge from a service station or from certain big-box stores. Certain merchants may sell products and services that appear identical or similar to those sold by eligible merchants, or may be separate merchants located on the same premises as eligible merchants, but are classified in different categories by Mastercard. For purchases at other merchants, you will only earn regular rewards points.</p>

        <h3>Recurring Bill</h3>
        <p>Recurring bill payments are defined as monthly or regular payments automatically charged by a merchant to your National Bank World Elite Mastercard credit card. Not all merchants offer recurring bill payments, and not all recurring payments are considered recurring bill payments. Certain payments therefore may not entitle you to earn more points.</p>

        <h3>À la Carte Travel</h3>
        <p>To earn 2 points per dollar in purchases, you must make your eligible purchases via the À la carte TravelTM Agency section of our À la carte RewardsTM site.</p>

        <h3>Other Purchases</h3>
        <p>For example, if each month you charge $400 in groceries, $200 in gas, $100 in recurring bill payments and $150 in other purchases to your card, your $850 in purchases will earn you 2,750 points, as follows: 2,000 points for grocery purchases (since the total gross monthly amount is $850, i.e., under $2,500), 400 points for gas purchases, 200 points for recurring bill payments and 150 points for other purchases.</p>
        
        <h3>Reimbursement of Travel Expenses</h3>
        <p>Clients must submit required documents within the given deadline. Certain conditions may apply. Only the primary cardholder (“Cardholder”) of National Bank World Elite Mastercard whose account is in good standing can request a refund of travel expenses.

          An account in good standing refers to an account linked to a credit card which complies with the Agreement governing the use of the credit card and which is not subject to any restrictions.
          
          For example, the annual fees related to the credit card must have been paid in full. The maximum amount that can be submitted for reimbursement between January 1st and December 31 of each year is $150.
          
          Eligible expenses include:
          
          airport parking fees
          baggage fees
          seat selection fees
          access to airport lounges worldwide
          airline ticket upgrades
          The claim must be submitted within 60 days of the purchase date and accompanied by proof of purchase. The travel fees must be charged to the National Bank World Elite Mastercard credit card. The maximum reimbursement amount is $150 per account. The refund will be issued within 7 business days following the request approval date and after receiving all required information.
          
          National Bank reserves the right to request additional supporting documents for validation purposes (e.g. invoices). You must keep all receipts and supporting documents for a period of 12 months from the date of your claim. An amount not claimed in a year cannot be carried over to the following year. For more information or to obtain the refund form, sign in to rewards.nbc.ca, click the Refund of travel expenses tab and complete the form, you can also contact us at 1-888-296-8881 (toll-free).
          
          </p>

        <h3>Credit Terms</h3>
        <p>Grace period: No interest will be charged on purchases made during the month, provided the client pays the balance in full within twenty-one (21) days of the statement date. This grace period does not apply to cash advances or balance transfers.

          Minimum payment: If your account balance is lower than $10, you must pay the entire balance.
          
          If you reside in the province of Quebec, your minimum payment will correspond to 5% of the credit card account balance plus any overdue payment or $10, whichever amount is higher.
          
          If you reside outside of Quebec, your minimum payment represents 2.5% of the credit card account balance plus any overdue payment or $10, whichever amount is higher.
