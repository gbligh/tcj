        <h2>Prvacy Policy</h2>
        <p>By accessing and using THE CANADIAN JETSETTER Site and Services, and by providing personally identifiable information to us through the Site and by purchasing our Services, you are indicating your acceptance to be bound by the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy and THE CANADIAN JETSETTER TERMS OF USE.  If you do not accept the terms and conditions set forth in our Privacy Policy and THE CANADIAN JETSETTER TERMS OF USE, please do not access or use the Site or the Services, and do not provide personally identifiable information to us through the Site or the Services.

            If you want to use our Site or purchase our Services or both, we need you to provide basic information about yourself.  You therefore expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the personally identifiable information you provide to us when you use the Site or purchase our Services, in accordance with applicable laws. Below we have set out a summary of the privacy principles which we follow.
            
            Subject to applicable laws, we will only collect, use and disclose your personal information with your consent, and, once we collect your personal information, we will only use and disclose it for purposes we have identified to you.
            
            While we aim to inform you how we will use your personal information at the time we collect it from you, you should be aware that, generally, we collect your personal information for the following purposes: (a) to offer you access to and use of our Site and the Services;  (b) to respond to your requests and questions; (c) to fulfill our public duty, to detect or prevent fraud, and to safeguard our interests and the interests of our users; (d) to develop, enhance and market our Services; (e) to manage and develop our business and operations, including personnel and employment matters; (f) in connection with an actual or possible corporate reorganization, merger or amalgamation with another entity, or an actual or possible sale of some or all of our assets; (g) to meet legal and regulatory requirements; or (h) to carry out any other purpose that you have authorized or that is required or permitted by law.
            
            We may engage service providers to assist us with fulfilling the purposes that are set out above, and, in some instances, these service providers may be located outside Canada.  We select service providers that we understand protect personal information in a manner that is comparable to the protection we provide under our own privacy policies.  Please be advised that personal information may be subject to, and accessed under, the laws of the countries in which our service providers operate.  If you have any questions about our transfer of personal information to our service providers outside Canada, please contact our Privacy Officer at the contact information provided below.
            
            We protect personal information against such risks as loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, modification or destruction, through generally accepted security measures.  However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security measures.
            
            You may withdraw your consent for us to manage your personal information in a particular way, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice.  However, this may limit our ability to provide you with certain services or products.  You may contact us for more information regarding the implications of withdrawing consent.
            
            
            In some instances, we may use "cookies", which are small text files offered to your computer by servers in order to keep track of your browser as you navigate a website.  Cookies may be stored on your hard drive, or in temporary (cache) memory, in which case they are deleted when you shut down your browser or turn off your computer.  We may use cookies to record session information, such as your browsing habits and past activity, to enable us to provide you with improved services such as customized webpage content.  You can disable cookies using your Internet browser's settings.  Please consult your browser's help function for information on how to disable cookies.  Note that if you disable cookies, certain features of the Site may not function properly.  Your use of the Site signifies your consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information, as it relates to our use of cookies.  For the purposes of customizing your experience and securing your account, we may also log and record IP addresses which are associated with log-in activity.
            
            The Site may contain links to other websites that are provided as a convenience only, and which may have different privacy policies and practices than we do.  We have no responsibility for these third party websites, and you are advised to review the privacy policies of any third party websites you choose to visit.
            
            For more information about our privacy policies and practices, please contact our Privacy Officer at thecanadianjetsetter@gmail.com.
